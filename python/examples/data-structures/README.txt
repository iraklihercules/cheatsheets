1. Binary Search Trees (BST):
- Binary trees where each node has at most two children, and the left child is less than the parent, while the right child is greater.
- Useful for searching, insertion, and deletion operations with a time complexity of O(log n) in the average case.

2. Heaps:
- Specialized tree-based data structures that satisfy the heap property (either min-heap or max-heap).
- Useful for implementing priority queues and for efficient retrieval of the minimum or maximum element.

3. Graphs:
- A collection of nodes (vertices) and edges that connect pairs of nodes.
- Various representations are used, such as adjacency lists or adjacency matrices.
- Common algorithms on graphs include depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), and algorithms for finding shortest paths (Dijkstra's algorithm, Bellman-Ford algorithm).
